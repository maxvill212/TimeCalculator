# Work Calculator

## Purpose
Calculates hours worked and rounds to the quarter hour

## Origins
At my current work we use punch cards and our shifts are rounded by the quarter hour.
I decided to create a small app to easily know how long I worked and where to round my minutes

## Technologies
### IDE:
[Android Studio 4.0](https://developer.android.com/studio/)

## Setup
Allow USB debugging from your Android phone
Run the app to your phone

## TODO
* Redo logic (very inefficient and messy)
* Have a database that stores hours for the week and adds them up at wish

* Maybe add my pay for the given time?
